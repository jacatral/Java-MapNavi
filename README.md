# Java-MapNavi
This repository is dedicated to providing files for a Ready To Program program which is a simple app for navigating a 2d array. Given that the array hold integer values, '0' is empty space to traverse,'1' marks a wall, '2' is the start point, '3' is the end point, and '4' is the path from the start to the end. This program will require four additional files, which are easy to make by hand, image files for RtP to draw for the map. The following files should be in the same folder as the .java file (which also has the MapData.txt for if the program should start with a preloaded map): 
"WALL.PNG" (for me its a 50x50 px black square),
"START.PNG" (50x50 px green square used for reference),
"END.PNG" (50x50 px red square used for reference),
"PATH.PNG" (50x50 px blue square used for reference)
